## Project

This forms the front-end element of the overall project, which connects to the back-end server.

This site serves up news articles, each of which can be accessed for more information, and interacted with by voting and commenting.

## Instructions

`Browsing` - click on "Articles" to see a list of all articles.

`Topic` - click on a topic from the dropdown list to filter by topic.

`Sort` - click on a value to sort by that value (e.g. The number of votes it has).

`Order` - Click on a value to display results in ascending or descending order.

`Choosing` - Click on an article title or picture to view more information.

`Voting` - Up-vote or down-vote an article by clicking a + or - respectively.

`Commenting` - Type in the box and click post to post a comment. Note that login functionality doesn't yet exist, and thus, you will be identified as "jessjelly".

`Deleting` - Click "delete" to delete a comment posted by jessjelly.

`Redirecting` - If you venture off-course, as a result of entering an incorrect path for example, you'll see a message and a button that allows you to return to the articles page.
